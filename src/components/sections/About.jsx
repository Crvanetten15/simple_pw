Hi, I am Connor, a Software Developer. I am on the evergoing pursuit to make ideas come to life through code. If you can think of it, I assure there is a path to it through modern technology, and I would like to aid you on that journey.


Along side my development motives, I run a tech blog. If you are interested in the Cloud, the Web, coding in general or just what I think please navigate to the text tab above.


Outside of programming, I enjoy powerlifting and hiking. These help me achieve a balance between my digital life and my physical life. If you happen to share these extended hobbies feel free to contact me regarding them as well.


Enjoy some of my highlights below. If you would like to see more of my work, you can find my full projects list here.
