          Participated in Trek10â€™s Launch Program, where we were trained on AWS services to pass our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam. After Launch, I was assigned to a delivery team with another intern and mentor, where we worked on 3 open-source projects. Each task centered around creating a command line utility for SAM template transformations. At our final delivery day we showcased each individual and displayed &qout;CFN-TRANSFORM&qout;, which was a PyPi package allowing the user to retrieve a transformed template without AWS credentials.
