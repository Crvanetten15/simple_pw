        I currently work for a software company as a applications developer working on a MES system based in both desktop and web technologies. Our tech stack includes Progress ABL, .NET, Python, Javascript, and SQL to create multiple different systems. I currently work to improve this stack and bring our company closer to software industry standards along with making updates and patches to our current builds.

      <p className="">
        Outside of my 9-5, I am extremely passionate about Web Development and CLI development both of which I offer freelance work if needed. Please feel free to examine my projects along these topics if you are looking for my services.
