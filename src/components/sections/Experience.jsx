          Participated in Trek10â€™s Launch Program, where we were trained on AWS
          services to pass our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam. After
          Launch, I was assigned to a delivery team with another intern and
          mentor, where we worked on 3 open-source projects. Each task centered
          around creating a command line utility for SAM template transformations.
          At our final delivery day we showcased each individual and displayed
          &34;CFN-TRANSFORM&34;, which was a PyPi package allowing the user to retrieve
          a transformed template without AWS credentials.
